            <p class="title">Genshin Impact</p>
            Genshin Impact is my current game of choice. It is an open world gacha game released on September 28th of 2020. It features a rich world full of enemy camps, puzzles, and landmarks. It's main appeal is the gorgeous world, compelling story and also the beautiful characters there are to pull for. My personal favorite is the Raiden Shogun, god of lightning and shogun of Inazuma. I have gotten 4 copies of her and she does absolutely ridiculous damage. I have completed all of the story that is currently available, but I am lacking in the exploration of the more recent due to time constraints. I have spent money on the game and have nearly every currently available 5* character, the only ones I am missing are Klee, Ganyu, Yoimiya, Sangonomiya Kokomi, Shenhe, Yae Miko, Kamisato Ayato and Cyno.

            <p class="title">Honkai Impact 3rd</p>
            Honkai Impact 3rd is an action RPG made by the same developers of Genshin Impact, releasing to global public on March 28th 2018. While being a less impressive game in terms of development than Genshin Impact, Honkai still has things going for it, mainly it's far richer story, driven by character drama rather than the plot demanding to go forward. I have been playing the game for a bit over a year now and have made quite some accomplishments, my highest one being reaching Nirvana, which is the highest tier of the endgame gamemode Superstring Dimension. This accomplishment was thanks mainly to my incredible Lightning team, with the Herrscher of Thunder leading the charge, being my favorite character. I have many characters with all of their best gear, mainly the Herrscher of Thunder, Sentience, Reason, Flamescion and Human Ego, as well as Eden, Elysia, Fischl, Li Sushang and Azure Empyrea.

            <p class="title">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</p>
            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a platform fighting game made by Nintendo and latest in the franchise. It has quickly become my biggest timewaster game that I play when I am bored and can't think of anything else to play. I have not done much of note in the game, other than me being kinda cracked insane goopy gooped up with the sauce insane crisp kinda balls when playing as Joker or Pichu.

              Pokemon is a franchise I have enjoyed for years, being with me even since I was a kid, but it wasn't until 2016 when Pokemon Sun and Moon came out that I really became a fan of the franchise. My biggest accomplishment would have to be getting 14/15 stamps on my Ultra Moon game, with the only one I am missing being the 50 streak for Super Multi Battles.

            <p class="title">Sonic the Hedgehog</p>
            Sonic the Hedgehog has been one of the more important game franchises to my life. I had long watched videos of the gameplay and reviews for games, but it wasnt until christmas of 2016 that I would get my first every sonic game: Sonic Adventure 2. SA2 is to this day still my favorite game in the franchise, followed by Sonic Generations. I cannot say that I have played all of the sonic games, and that is with reasons, but I have done my best to experience as many games as possible. I am looking forward to playing the most recent title, Sonic Frontiers. I hope to go into the game blind, and stay as unspoiled as possible.

           Super Mario Odyssey is my favorite game of all time as it stands. I can talk about this game forever. From the ridiculously fun movement system, the troves of secrets hidden around the map, the incredible addicting balloon world mini-game... Super Mario Odyssey was a magical experience and I do not regret buying it one bit. I had long awaited the day that I could buy a Nintendo Switch and this title was one of the main reasons. I love this game and hope for everyone I know to play it.
